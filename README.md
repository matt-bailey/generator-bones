**PLEASE NOTE: This Yeoman generator is pretty old now and I haven't had the time to update or provide support for it. You're probably better off using the default [Yeoman webapp generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp).**

# generator-bones

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matt-bailey/generator-bones.png)](https://travis-ci.org/matt-bailey/generator-bones)

[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator for scaffolding out a basic web project.

It's based on [generator-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp), but somewhat simplified and with some other useful stuff added in - [Grunticon](https://github.com/filamentgroup/grunticon) for all your SVG needs, and [Assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble) for building static HTML files from modular templates and data.

## Getting started

- Make sure you have [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) installed:
    `npm install -g yo`
- Install the generator: `npm install -g generator-bones`
- Run: `yo bones`
- Run: `grunt`

This is what your project will look like once you've run `yo bones` and `grunt`:
